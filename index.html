<p> There are many aspects that can cause seperation between groups of people. Specifically, the income gap is one of the most common things that cause seperation among groups of people in the US. Movements such as " I am the 99%" and "Occupy Wallstreet" have shed light on these dividing issues in the past. In this project I wanted to probe deeper into the separating factors that plague the US. The following charts provided by the Pew Research Center will provide information regarding the issues that people in the US face in statistical and graphical forms. </p>

<p>The first chart shown will focus on the personal finances of Americans on a national scale documented by the Pew Research Center.</p>

<h2>National Satisfaction</h2>
<div id="" style="width:100%; height:400px;"></div>
<p><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/national-conditions/national-satisfaction-2/">Information for second graph</a></p>
<p> The following is information displaying the national satisfaction of Americans in the US. According to the Pew Research Center, satisfaction amid Americans has a close ties 
with the current state of the legal system in the country. Specifically, satisfaction has close ties with politics, because they are a direct indicator of how people decide things are going in the country. The following chart displays the satisfaction Americans feel towards how things are going politically in the US. Looking at this information, ask yourself how the importance of politics and voting are linked with satisfaction in the US. Do you feel that this creates another source of division and inequality among Americans that cannot vote (exa: illegal immigrants, illiterate, etc).</p>
